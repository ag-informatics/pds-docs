What Comes Next
==============================================

**Geographic Matching:**
To meet original needs, the Plant Data Service will support the matching of plant data to geographic locations. These locations will determine what data is shown and from what data owner and will support the coordinate, county, state, and region levels.

**Functionality Expansion:**
More functions will be added to the Plant Data Service. These functions will support requests for plant searches and domain-specific data (e.g. a function that supports the look up of agronomic, phenologic, or stress-related data for a plant given a geographic location).

**Administrative Panel Creation:**
Since previous attempts to find an adequate data administration panel have failed, scoping will be conducted to identify needs for an administration panel that allows data owners to edit, create, and delete data stored within the PDS.

**Multi-Dictionary Support:**
Currently, famport only allows one data dictionary per owner. Multi-dictionary support will be necessary in the near future.
